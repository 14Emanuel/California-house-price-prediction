# CALIFORNIA STATE HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

This project will be solving a Supervised Machine Learning Problem. Real Estate Companies relie on data analysis and prediction to make smart investments. To help such a company achieve their goal, I am going to Implement a Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm on a previous house census dataset to build a predictive model. The model is going to predict the house value depending on a number of independent features. From such a model, the company will be able to predict house values in one location and compare them with the house values in other locations in the market. This will prompt the decision of where to make investments,withdraw, or hold on for sometime.

## DEMONSTRATION

Link the to the Web Application: https://house-value-predicto.herokuapp.com/



## HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION

Open the Application link

Input Prediction entries (to find relevant entries go to my github repo open the file 'testing phot dataset.png')

Press the Predict button

The Output button will show you the predicted house value
