California State House Value Prediction

This project will be solving a supervised Machine Learning problem. I am going to Implement a Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the median House Value of houses in California State.

The dataset that I will be using to train and build the model is derived from 1990 California Census.

## Demostration
This is a Web Application that I deployed on Heroku Cloud Platform; It is a Demonstrates how my Machine Learning Model Works.
